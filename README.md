## üöÄ Getting Started

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/l3dlp/js-webp-convertor.git
   cd js-webp-convertor
   ```

2. Serve with any static file server:
   ```bash
   # Using Node.js serve (install with: npm install -g serve)
   npx serve
   
   # Or Python's built-in HTTP server
   python -m http.server
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or whatever port your server uses)

### Integration

To integrate the converter into your own website:

1. Copy the `src` directory to your project
2. Include the necessary scripts and styles
3. Customize as needed (see the [Customization](#customization) section)

## üîß Customization

You can modify the application by:

- Editing the `main.css` file to change styles
- Adding more languages to `translations.json`
- Modifying quality defaults in the JavaScript
- Changing supported file types

## üåê Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support the WebP format and the Canvas API:
- Chrome (versions 23+)
- Firefox (versions 65+)
- Edge (versions 18+)
- Safari (versions 14+)
- Opera (versions 12.1+)
- Chrome for Android & iOS Safari

## üìä Benefits of WebP

- **Smaller File Size**: WebP images are typically 25-35% smaller than JPEGs at equivalent quality
- **Faster Loading**: Reduced file size means faster page loading and better user experience
- **SEO Benefits**: Page speed is a ranking factor for search engines
- **Transparency Support**: WebP supports alpha channel transparency like PNG but with smaller file sizes
- **Animation Support**: WebP can replace animated GIFs with much smaller file sizes
